Visit the deployed website [here](https://sophieworsnop.netlify.app/)

This website was built to showcase what I'm all about as a full stack software / web developer and host my work from the last 10 years as an architectural designer.

I am also an avid knitter so I will be building features to aid with knitting pattern design.

I decided to use components of a Material-UI template from Creative Tim to get started with the front-end.

# Tech
